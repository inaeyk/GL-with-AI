# BlackStringToy

Isolated Stage 4AO-D-E1 black-string application seam.

The application is compiled with `CH_SPACEDIM=2`, `GR_SPACEDIM=4`, and
`DEFAULT_TENSOR_DIM=4`. Direction 0 is radial `x`; direction 1 is compact and
periodic `z`. Its production state contains exactly 18 variables, including
one stored `hww/Aww` representative with hidden multiplicity applied only in
target contractions.

Live hooks:

- `initialData()` runs the validated GP initializer through `BoxLoops` and
  delegates ghost ownership to the framework;
- `specificEvalRHS()` obtains real fourth-order derivatives, expands the
  reduced state to target `d=4`, directly calls locked GRChombo for all 13
  physical rows, evaluates five moving-puncture gauge rows, and applies the
  fixed GP source once to lapse;
- `specificUpdateODE()` applies determinant normalization, weighted
  hidden-aware `A`-trace removal, and the inherited positivity policy after
  the normal update;
- `specificPostTimeStep()` emits exactly `H`, `Mx`, and `Mz` without mutating
  evolution variables.

Build the serial E1 executable with the qualified compiler tuple:

```bash
make -C code/BlackStringToy -j1 all DIM=2 DEBUG=FALSE OPT=TRUE \
  MPI=FALSE USE_HDF=FALSE CXX=g++ \
  FC=/usr/bin/x86_64-linux-gnu-gfortran-15 \
  "CSHELLCMD=/bin/csh -f -c"
```

`params_stage4ao_de1.txt` is an isolated check-only setup. A project-local
pre-include compiles locked `ChomboParameters` grid loops at
`CH_SPACEDIM=2`, then restores target tensor loops at dimension four. Deeper
locked runtime infrastructure still uses tensor-wide `FOR` loops on
grid-dimensional objects. The established failure path is
`AMR::define -> GRAMRLevel::define -> BoundaryConditions::define ->
RealVect::operator[]`: the `DEFAULT_TENSOR_DIM=4` loop reaches `i=2` while
indexing the `CH_SPACEDIM=2` `RealVect m_center`. The source incompatibility
and first adaptation site are established, but the full adaptation surface
remains under investigation and is not repaired in E1. This file does not
claim
sustained evolution, AMR/MPI qualification, an accepted physical radial
boundary, perturbation growth, horizons, or PETSc/AHFinder support. The older
smoke parameter file is unchanged.

The application fixture in `tests/chombo_live_application` uses real
`FArrayBox`, `LevelData`, `BoxLoops`, fourth-order derivatives, and
`LevelData::exchange`. It checks:

- all 18 initialized and RHS slots against their pointwise owners;
- four-resolution manufactured convergence for Ricci, encoded Z, advection,
  shift terms, lapse derivatives, combined rows, and `H,Mx,Mz`;
- both global periodic-z wraps and, separately, first-, second-, and
  mixed-derivative production stencils at both sides of the internal
  two-box seam, using scalar/even and one-z fields with fourth-order
  convergence, no translation sign flip, and independent nonperiodic radial
  ghosts;
- four-resolution GP residuals for all 18 rows and `H,Mx,Mz`, including raw
  and fixed-source lapse drift;
- actual pre-output input-registration, RHS-storage, gauge/source, and
  update-hook mutations for ownership, coordinate, cleanup, source, and
  legacy-layout defects;
- worst manufactured row/component, `IntVect`, physical `(x,z)`, and parity
  provenance at every resolution.

The manufactured and GP residual measurements exclude radial-boundary cells.
They qualify the interior application seam, not the current extrapolation
policy as a physical radial boundary.

The validated cleanup values are determinant `0.9999999999999997` and
weighted trace `-5.204170427930421e-18`.
