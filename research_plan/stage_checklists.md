# Stage Checklists

These checklists are gatekeeping tools. They do not replace the reproduction plan or project outline. Each stage should be reviewed before moving to the next. For code-generating agents, completion requires human review and approval, not just self-review.

## Stage 0 - Infrastructure and reproducibility

Goal: establish local/remote development, repo hygiene, logs, smoke tests, and reproducible scripts.

- [x] Create GitHub repo and concise scaffold.
- [x] Set up WSL2 Ubuntu on Windows PC.
- [x] Authenticate GitHub access from WSL.
- [x] Install/use Docker Desktop with WSL2 backend.
- [x] Run GRChombo BinaryBH very-cheap Docker smoke test locally.
- [x] Confirm raw HDF5 output is stored under ignored `runs/`.
- [x] Create project logs and Codex logs.
- [x] Add smoke-test scripts.
- [ ] Confirm one-command smoke-test script works from a clean local state.
- [ ] Confirm plotting workflow is either implemented or explicitly deferred.

Gate: do not begin C++ implementation until the repo is clean, raw outputs are ignored, and smoke-test scripts are reviewed and approved by the user.

## Stage 1 - Public GRChombo capability/source map

Goal: understand what public GRChombo already provides before editing source code.

- [x] Clone public GRChombo into ignored `external/GRChombo`.
- [x] Create capability map.
- [x] Create source map.
- [x] Identify CCZ4, gauge, AMR, output, initial-data, and AH-finder infrastructure.
- [x] Identify `GR_SPACEDIM` / `CH_SPACEDIM` distinction.
- [x] Identify `hww/Aww` and `g_ww/K_ww` naming issues.
- [x] Inspect `ApparentHorizonFinderTest2D`.
- [x] Record that public CCZ4 appears dimension-parameterized but not fully cartoon-source-term aware.
- [x] Add explicit hazards/silent-failure section in `docs/grchombo/capability_map.md`.
- [x] Verify exact `AHFunctions.hpp` enum-order assumption around `hww` access: verified from public source that under `GR_SPACEDIM != CH_SPACEDIM`, `hww` is read positionally as `c_K - 1`, while `Aww` is read via `c_Aww`.
- [x] Decide whether to run a `CH_SPACEDIM=2`, `GR_SPACEDIM=4` compile preflight.

Gate: do not proceed to Stage 1.5 or create `BlackStringToy` until the source/capability maps and hazard notes are reviewed and approved by the user.

## Stage 1.5 - Target-dimension compile preflight

Goal: check whether the intended compile configuration `CH_SPACEDIM=2`, `GR_SPACEDIM=4` is technically viable before physics implementation.

- [x] Identify the smallest public test/example suitable for compile preflight.
- [x] Preferred first preflight target: adapt or reuse `Tests/ApparentHorizonFinderTest2D` as a controlled `DIM=2`, `GR_SPACEDIM=4` compile experiment, if build tooling allows.
- [x] Reproduce the baseline `DIM=2` Docker build/run path for `Tests/ApparentHorizonFinderTest2D`.
- [ ] If that target is unsuitable, choose the smallest public test/example that probes the `GR_SPACEDIM != CH_SPACEDIM` path.
- [ ] Attempt `DIM=2` build with `GR_SPACEDIM=4` using controlled compiler flags or minimal local copy.
- [ ] Record which files compile and which fail.
- [ ] Check whether `AHSphericalGeometry` guards or other `GR_SPACEDIM==3` assumptions trigger.
- [ ] Check whether `hww/Aww` enum variables are required for compilation.
- [x] Document blockers in `docs/grchombo/build_notes.md`.
- [x] Record that a successful compile is not evidence of physical correctness.

Gate: do not proceed to Stage 2 until this stage is reviewed and approved by the user. Do not treat any `GR_SPACEDIM=4` run as physically meaningful until the relevant equations, variables, and diagnostics are reviewed and approved by the user.

## Stage 2 - Editable build and BlackStringToy skeleton

- [ ] Create `BlackStringToy` skeleton only after user approval.
- [ ] Preserve known-working build/run behavior initially.
- [ ] Rename files/classes minimally.
- [ ] Build successfully.
- [ ] Run a smoke test.
- [ ] Confirm output variables and parameter parsing still work.
- [ ] Record exactly what was inherited from public examples.
- [ ] Clearly label the skeleton as "not physical black-string evolution."

Gate: do not proceed to Stage 3 or add black-string initial data until the skeleton builds/runs and the diff is reviewed and approved by the user. Do not treat skeleton outputs as physically meaningful.

## Stage 3 - 5D black-string initial data and GL perturbation

Goal: implement analytic initial data and perturbation in a controlled way.

- [ ] Write or verify formulas for 5D black-string initial data in chosen coordinates.
- [ ] Decide exact variables to initialize: `chi`, `h_ij`, `hww`, `K`, `A_ij`, `Aww`, lapse, shift, `B`, `Gamma`, `Theta`.
- [ ] Verify `hww/Aww` enum placement before implementation.
- [ ] Implement parameters: `r0`, `L`, `epsilon`, `n`, `eps_cut`.
- [ ] Implement turduckening cutoff.
- [ ] Implement GL perturbation in `chi`.
- [ ] Run `t=0` or very short tests only.
- [ ] Check periodicity in `z`.
- [ ] Check smoothness outside cutoff.
- [ ] Check constraints and gauge quantities qualitatively.

Gate: do not proceed to Stage 4 or run long GL evolutions until `t=0` fields, parameter parsing, and constraints are reviewed and approved by the user. Do not treat outputs as physically meaningful until the relevant equations, variables, and diagnostics are reviewed and approved by the user.
